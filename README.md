## Algorithms ##

Repo used to document and organize various implementations of data structures and algorithms in preparation 
for upcoming technical interviews. At the moment everything is written in Python, which is the programming language
I am most comfortable with. My intention, in the long run, is to rewrite my code in C++ and Java for extra practice.
